    		<div class="dsentras-thesis-is">dSentra’s thesis is that in order to increase decentralization within the Ethereum network, we need to MAXIMIZE the usage of GMDPs [governance minimized, decentralized protocols], specifically GMDPs that issue decentralized, uncensorable, stablecoins, like RAI, HAI and OpenDollar - these protocols constitute the core of the MoneyGod league, their products are also known as controlled peg stablecoins</div>

        				<p class="decentralization-of-the">Decentralization of the Ethereum network is THE endgame. Public goods should not suffer from under-production, tragedy of the commons or free rider exploits because of private [or certain groups] interest clashing with the general interest in the detriment of the public good itself (credible neutrality of block space) </p>
